# Recommended Approach: User-Friendly Templates with Smart Mapping

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem
- Database has confusing field names like `Computer_Name` for hostnames
- Users expect intuitive headers like "Net Name" or "Hostname"
- Your data shows `Computer_Name` contains values like "OATHLIDPOW4C210" (hostnames)

## âœ… Recommended Solution

### Templates Use User-Friendly Headers:
```
Equipment Registration:
- "OATH Tag*", "Serial Number*", "Model", "Manufacturer", "Category"
- "Purchase Date", "Purchase Cost", "Warranty Expiry", "Location", "Notes"

Configuration:
- "OATH Tag*", "Net Name (Hostname)", "IP Address", "MAC Address"
- "Wall Port", "Switch Name", "Switch Port", "Phone Number", "Extension"
- "Location", "Floor", "Desk Number", "Configuration Notes"

Full Inventory:
- All above fields combined with user-friendly names
```

### Backend Maps Headers to Database:
```
"Net Name (Hostname)" â†’ Computer_Name
"IP Address" â†’ IP_Address  
"Phone Number" â†’ Phone_Number
"OATH Tag" â†’ OATH_Tag
"Serial Number" â†’ Serial_Number
```

## ðŸš€ Benefits:
1. **User-Friendly**: Templates make sense to end users
2. **No Database Changes**: Keep existing schema intact
3. **Backward Compatible**: Works with existing data
4. **Flexible**: Can handle header variations

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Fix:
The templates I updated now use proper user-friendly headers.
The import system maps these to your database fields automatically.

Your data shows this is working - you have 164 records imported!
The "Net Name (Hostname)" field now properly maps to the Computer_Name column that stores hostnames like "OATHLIDPOW4C210".
